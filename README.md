# Fullstack-NET_MaxG_ChasAcademy22
# Collection of Assignments
Welcome to the collection of my C# Projects! 
This project is a simple application that demonstrates some basic C# programming concepts that I learned during Fullstack .NET program.

# Prerequisites
To the project, you will need the following software installed on your machine:
* .NET Core

# Running the program
To run the project, follow these steps:
 - Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
 - Run the following command to start the application: dotnet run
 - Alternatively use an IDE to run it

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use it by following the on-screen prompts.

# List of projects
## 11. Login
- A login program which is based off a class User with two properties, username and password
- The program then allows for user input and compares it towards the instanced objects. This is done within a while-loop
- If there is a matched user, the program sets a an object to the currentuse.
- The program then allows for a change of password for the logged in user 
- Choosing the log-out option exits the loop

## 10. Arrays
- A simple array program
- The program created an array and allows the user to determine its length and contents
- The program then posts the array, and again but reversed

## 9.OOP Polymorphism
- A program that illustrates how inherited and overriden methods work
- A parent class Geometry is created with a number of sub-classes
- The sub-classes inherit and overrides the Area() method and returns the area for the respective shape
- A number of instances of the objects are created with various parameters and their area are calculated and presented

## 8. OOP Inherit
- This program is built to further explore the concept of classes, more specifically how inherited classes behave
- A parent-class is created with a number of properties
- A number of sub classes are created with their own local properties and methods, inherited properties and overridden methods
- The sub class Ape are further broken down into two additional sub classes, Orangutang and Gorilla which are slightly modified
- A number of instances of the objects listed are created with some various parameters
- A number of methods are called to illustrate the overriden and local methods

## 7. OOP Class
- A lesser program that explores the concept of classes and constructors
- A class with a two properties is created along with a constructor that takes one parameter
- The program then instances two object of the class Circle with various parameter and runs the GetArea method designated in the Circle class

## 6. Fizz Buzz
- A classic Fizz Buzz program
- It takes a user input and checks for Fizz and Buzz, or Fizzbuzz by iterating through the numbers to see if they are evenly divided by 3, 5 or both
- The Modulus operator is the primary tool in this

## 5. Rock Paper Scissors
- This program is a simple rock-paper-scissors game
- Within a while loop, the AI randoms a number between 1-3 which is set to correspond to one of the choices
- A number of if-statements within a switch case based off the users input then checks the result towards the AI:s random. 
- A counter keeps track of who wins and loses then posts the results at the end of the game

## 4. Menu system
- This program showcases a switch function within a while-loop
- It presents a menu of workshop 1 through 3 and allows the user to select a program to run
- A function was created per workshop and is called in the respective switch-cases

## 3. Chessboard
- This program serves to present a matrix of two different icons based on user input.
- The matrix should be every other icon, for as many columns and rows, equal to the input
- The program iterates through odd and even numbers up to the user inputs then fills string based on the result
- It then prints alternating rows up to the amount designated by the users

## 2. Numbers game
- A program where a number between 1-20 is randomized, which the user can then guess
- A number of if-statements in a while loop allows the user to play until either the user guessed correctly, or guessed five times

## 1. My First Program
- A simple compare a number program using an if-statement
- A for loop prints all numbers up to designated variable
